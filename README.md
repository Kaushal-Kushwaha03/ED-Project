**Self Controlled Synchronous machine Drive employing Load Commutated Thyristor Inverter**
Matlab simulation of Self Controlled Synchronous machine Drive employing Load Commutated Thyristor Inverter
:Large power drives use wound field synchronous motors, while medium power drives use permanent magnet synchronous motors. The drive uses two converters: source side converter and load side converter. The source side converter is a 6-pulse line-commutated thyristor converter, functioning as a line-commutated rectifier for firing angles 0 ≤ αs ≤ 90∘ and a line-commutated inverter for firing angles 90∘ ≤ αs ≤ 180∘. When operating at a leading power factor, load side converter thyristors can be commutated by motor induced voltages, known as load commutation. To prevent commutation overlap and turn-off, the firing angle must be less than 180° when working as an inverter.
